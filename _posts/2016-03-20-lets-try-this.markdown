#Let's try blogging

So, have been setting up this jekyll thing. It's pretty cool to see change instantly.
And when ready, push to github to update the page. Neat.

Also created a VM that uses a physical disk, pretty cool but windows has some stupid stuff going on that makes is all harder.
Finished setting it up and now running bspwm, which took a while to set up. 
All in all a pretty productive day.

Now to get back to gaming!
